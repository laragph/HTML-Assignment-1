    <p>As elementary and middle school students resume classes this fall, their teachers consider the in-person learning experience indispensable.</p>

    <p>Although children under 12 have yet to be approved for vaccination, many teachers feel that an in-person environment provides students with an invaluable opportunity to learn, socialize, and continue their recovery from the emotional trials of lockdown.</p>
    
    <p>Only 63% of Brooklynites have received a shot, contrasting with the New York City rate of 71%, making Brooklyn the least vaccinated borough. Some South Brooklyn neighborhoods straggle even further behind the pack. In one neighborhood spanning Brighton Beach, Coney Island, and Seagate, just 55% of residents have received their first dose.</p>
    
    <p>Ninety-five percent of New York public school staff have received a vaccine dose as of Monday morning, a rate boosted by a mandate that came into effect the same day. The requirement follows a harrowing summer marred by the rise of the Delta variant.</p>
    
    <p>Regardless of their sentiments towards the mandate, many teachers agree that in-person classes are integral to students' development.</p>
    
    <p>"Some of them were not as focused as they are in person," said Ivan Texler, who teaches 2nd graders at The Coney Island School. "There were parents sitting with them, sometimes giving them the answers for tests."</p>
    
    <p>In person, his students can socialize, albeit while three feet apart. "I think they're happier than they were last year and the year before," Texler said.</p>
    
    <p>"I guess they did the best they could under the circumstances," Texler said of pandemic era schooling. "It was really uncharted territory and, you know, they never did this before." Texler praised teachers for rapidly putting together their Google Classrooms following a short training period.</p>
    
    <p>Jason Batus, a 7th grade Earth Science teacher from the Mark Twain Intermediate School in Coney Island, said he's comfortable teaching even though some students have yet to be vaccinated. Socialization was scarce but precious while schools were closed; some of his students would join his Zoom office hours just to chat. Batus continues to remind his students that his door is always open.</p>
    
    <p>Mental health is top of mind for schools this fall due to the pandemic experience. In October, New York City schools will use the Devereux Student Strengths Assessment, or DESSA, to measure students&rsquo; social-emotional wellbeing. Additionally, schools in the city are bringing about 500 new social workers onto their staff.</p>
    
    <p>Texler says that some parents opted to enroll their children in charter schools or to home school this fall; enrollment fell by 16.53% at the Coney Island School between 2020 and 2021. Despite the jump, Texler believes that most parents are happy to see their kids learn in person.</p>
    
    <p>To Texler, like many of his colleagues, the choice to teach in person was the correct one.</p>
    
    <p>"I like it a lot," Texler says. "I'm the person that needs to be, you know, around the school community, the children, the parents, the teachers, I think it's a big motivator."</p>
